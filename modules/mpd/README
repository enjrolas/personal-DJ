[ABOUT]

This class/API is a PHP interface to the MPD (http://www.musicpd.org/). Using
this interface, you may write your own custom web-based interface to the MPD.

In the event you want to talk with me, you may email bcarlisle@24oz.com. I am
also a relatively frequent visitor of #mpd on FreeNet, under the nick of 'moot'.

More information can be found at the MPD-Class Homepage, http://mpd.24oz.com/.

[HISTORY]
I wrote this program in order to supplement the wonderful MPD in my own home audio 
environment. The interface that is supplied alongside MPD, called phpMp, worked, but 
was not as customizable as I would have liked. 

I currently use Netjuke (http://netjuke.sourceforge.net/) in order to catalog and 
locally play my MP3s, but I wanted a way to play songs through a playlist on my 
server.

This class solved that problem -- I could integrate both pieces of software from a 
look-and-feel perspective and also allow one to talk to the other.

This class has been tested with
   PHP 4.2.1, 4.2.3
   MPD 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.x

[INSTALLATION]
To install this php class, you simply need to place it in a directory that may be 
include()ed by PHP, and call require('mpd.class.php'). You may also place it in your 
PHP Include Path.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Please see the USAGE document for class methods/properties and examples on how to use 
this class.

[CREDITS]
Thank you to the MPD folks. You've put together a very easy-to-use and stable music daemon.
Another big thanks to Netjuke folks... absolutely great program!
