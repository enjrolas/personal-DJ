v1.2 - Released 05/05/2004
ENHANCEMENTS
* Program version compatibility table now does not allow incompatible commands to be sent to 
  the MPD. This is done to prevent sending outdated/incompatible commands.
* Added new MPD v0.9.1 commands: PLMove(), SetRandom(), SeekTo()
* Added MPD password authentication support.
* Added GetArtists() and GetAlbums() functions.
* Reflected 'volume' command deprecation in MPD v0.10.0

BUGFIXES
* None noted.


v1.1 - Released 09/23/2003
ENHANCEMENTS
 * There is no longer the need to call RefreshInfo directly; it is automatically called upon 
   connection to MPD. Although this may be considered a bad move by some purists, I feel that 
   it substantially increases usability.
 * Properties are now kept in sync with MPD. In other words, if a method call will modify a 
   MPD stateful variable (such as AdjustVolume()), it also will modify the object's property.
 * Methods that manually retrieve MPD settings (GetVolume(), GetStatistics(), etc.) will soon 
   be deprecated. Instead, be a nice developer and use the object property (eg, $mpd->volume, 
   $mpd->uptime, etc.).
 * Added the Find() method. Syntax is similar to Search().
 * Although the command queuing (bulk command) methods were included in v1.0, they were not 
   documented. The QueueCommand() and SendCommandQueue() are now official methods.
 
BUGFIXES
 * None noted.

v1.0 - Released 08/26/2003
